                            He is a vintage cowboy doll that originally belonged to a boy
                            named Andy Davis. As Andy's favorite since kindergarten, Woody
                            served as the leader of Andy's toys, a position he upheld by
                            looking out for each member of the group. When Andy enters
                            adulthood and leaves for college, Woody is donated to a little
                            girl named Bonnie Anderson. He remains with Bonnie for some time,
                            before choosing to become an owner-less antique devoted to helping
                            lost toys find owners, alongside his girlfriend Bo Peep.

                            He is a spaceman action figure originally belonging to Andy Davis.
                            Buzz was created during a time where astronauts were especially
                            popular amongst children. His arrival in the original Toy Story
                            created conflict with Andy's favorite toy Sheriff Woody, though
                            this rivalry would eventually blossom into a lifelong friendship.

                            An actual spork-turned-craft-project, Forky is pretty sure that he
                            doesn’t belong in Bonnie's room. Unfortunately, every time he
                            tries to get away, Woody yanks him back into an adventure he’d
                            rather skip. Forky is a toy that Bonnie made out of a disposable
                            spork, so he’s facing a crisis. He wants to fulfill his purpose as
                            a spork, but now has a new toy purpose thrust upon him.”

                            Bo is the romantic interest (later girlfriend) of Woody, providing
                            a calm and loving comfort whenever he is overwhelmed. She is noted
                            for using her shepherdess crook to hook her cowboy and bring him
                            closer in a romantic way. In private, she is a great deal more
                            daring with her words and actions, which Woody seems to be quite
                            fond of. She and her sheep were bought along with the lamp not too
                            long after Molly was born, due to the baby being scared of the
                            dark, which "broke every toy's heart", according to Woody. The
                            lamp comforted Molly and she would often have her hand lay on Bo's
                            feet.
